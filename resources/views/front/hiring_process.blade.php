                            <li><span>Choose a quiet location with minimal background noise (e.g., no traffic, phones,
pets, or children).</span></li>
                            <li><span>
                                Ensure a stable internet connection with a functioning webcam, speakers, and
microphone (or headset). Test your equipment before the interview begins.
                            </span></li>
                            <li><span>Be online at least 5 minutes prior to the scheduled interview time.</span></li>
                            <li><span>Dress professionally or smartly, without the need for a suit and tie, but a neat
appearance is recommended.</span></li>
                            <li><span>Try to remain relaxed and composed. If you are not accustomed to using a
webcam, practice with a friend via webcam to familiarize yourself with the process.</span></li>

                    <p class="mt-2">Remember, honesty is crucial. If you change your mind about working on a cruise ship
                        or your family opposes the idea, please inform us promptly to avoid
                        unprofessionalism.</p>
                    <p class="text-bold">If you need to attend a local interview, you will receive further instructions,
                        but
                        typically, you should bring all necessary documents, copies required for your job.

                        Dressing professionally and looking very presentable is essential during such
                        interviews.</p>
                    <p class="text-bold">When interacting with cruise companies or agencies, remember that recruiters
                        often
                        dedicate an entire day to interviewing candidates. You may receive a message
                        stating &quot;Please stand by between 9:00 and 14:00,&quot; which means they will call you as
                        soon as they complete interviews with other candidates. In this case, be prepared to
                        wait by your computer or phone while engaging in other tasks. Upon receiving a
                        notification, get ready and be in position. It is possible to conduct interviews using
                        your cellphone, although using a computer is the preferred method.</p>

                    <p>It is indeed essential to express gratitude towards the recruiter for the opportunity
                        they have provided. Education plays a significant role in the hospitality industry, and
                        demonstrating good manners and etiquette can leave a lasting impression. By taking a
                        moment to thank the recruiter, you showcase your professionalism and consideration
                        for their efforts, which can help you stand out in their memory amidst a potentially
                        exhausting day of work.</p>
                    <h3>POST-INTERVIEWS:</h3>
                    <p>Following up on an interview, whether it&#39;s positive or negative, is an important aspect
                        of the job search process. After some days, you can expect to receive an email
                        informing you about the outcome of your interview. If approved, the email will provide
                        you with the necessary instructions to proceed with the next steps.
                        <br>

                        In case you are working with an agency, they will handle the scheduling of the
                        interview with the company on your behalf. Remember that communication may take
                        some time, so be patient and responsive throughout the process.
                        Unfortunately, if you do not receive a favorable response, both the company and the
                        agency might not provide specific reasons for their decision. In such cases, you will
                        typically receive an automated email with a generic response. Common reasons for
                        rejection may include a lack of proficiency in English or not meeting the job
                        requirements. It is essential not to be discouraged by these setbacks and to continue
                        refining your skills and applying for suitable positions. Keep persisting, as the right
                        opportunity may come your way with time and effort.</p>
                    <h3>THE NEXT STEPS:</h3>
                    <p>When you receive approval from the company, they will provide you with a
                        comprehensive list of procedures and formalities that need to be completed. To
                        ensure a smooth and organized process, it is crucial to maintain well-structured folders
                        containing all your necessary documents and files. These may include safety
                        certificates, vaccine records, medical exam results, uniform size details, and a preview
                        of your contract. <br>
                        You should also be prepared for specific medical admission exams, as failing them
                        might result in elimination from the hiring process. It is advisable to research and
                        understand these exams beforehand to increase your chances of success. <br>
                        Acquiring the Basic Safety Training certificate or STCW (Standards of Training,
                        Certification, and Watchkeeping) is mandatory while you are on land. After submitting
                        the required documents, the company will continue with the hiring process and
                        update you on your status. They will also provide more information about the final
                        steps before boarding, such as airline tickets, hotel accommodations, your letter of
                        employment, and visa requirements (if applicable). <br>
                        It is essential to note that some companies may not cover the costs of airline tickets,
                        so be prepared for this possibility. Hotel accommodations will be provided by the
                        company if you arrive at the port one day before embarkation or they will give
                        instructions on how to reach the cruise terminal if you arrive on the same day.
                        The Letter of Employment (LOE) is a vital document that you must carry with you, as it
                        serves as proof of your employment and is required for immigration purposes and visa
                        applications. If you need a transit visa, the LOE will help you confirm your shipboard
                        joining date to the consular officials.</p>
                    <h3>THE FINAL STEPS:</h3>
                    <p>The embarkation date, which refers to the day you will join the ship, is usually
                        mentioned in your Letter of Employment (LOE). However, it is essential to note that
                        this date may change due to various factors such as the company&#39;s needs, availability
                        of positions, and other unforeseen circumstances. Embarkation dates can vary from a
                        few days to several weeks or even months. <br>
                        It is crucial for candidates to understand that they should not rush to quit their current
                        jobs or make significant life decisions until they have a clear and confirmed
                        embarkation date. The job search process in the maritime industry can be
                        unpredictable, and it is better to maintain stability in your personal life while waiting
                        for a definite date to join the ship. <br>
                        In summary, be patient and keep your current job until you receive a confirmed and
                        stable embarkation date from the company. This will ensure you are well-prepared
                        and have a secure foundation while navigating through the maritime job search
                        process.</p>
                    <p style="text-decoration: underline;" class="text-bold">BEFORE JOINING THE SHIP</p>
                    <p>There are a few steps to be taken before you can join a ship.</p>
                    <h3>THE DOCUMENTS YOU WILL NEED TO WORK ON A CRUISE SHIP</h3>
                    <p>These documents will be processed once you are offered a position. There’s no need
                        to concern you with obtaining any of these right now. We will assist you with the
                        necessary information on how to obtain them at the appropriate time.</p>
                    <h3>VALID PASSPORT</h3>
                    <p>Your passport must be valid for at least 1 year. If you do not have a passport yet, we
                        suggest that you obtain one now, before starting the process. Obtaining the passport
                        is at your own expense.</p>
                    <h3>SEAMAN BOOK</h3>
                    <p>In summary, a Seaman&#39;s Discharge Book, also known as a Seafarer&#39;s Book or Seaman&#39;s
                        Book, is a crucial legal document for mariners that verifies their seafaring status
                        according to the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and
                        Watchkeeping for Seafarers (STCW). Having a Seaman&#39;s Book is mandatory for crew

                        members working on seagoing vessels, including cruise ships, as it helps document
                        their maritime career and ensures compliance with international conventions. <br>
                        To apply for a Seaman&#39;s Book for cruise ship work, you typically need to book an
                        appointment, prepare the required documents such as a completed application form,
                        Certificate of Competency (CoC), relevant qualifications, copies of valid STCW &quot;Basic
                        Training&quot; certificates, passport copy, passport photos, and an ENG 1 Medical
                        Certificate. Most cruise companies provide Seaman&#39;s Books in accordance with the flag
                        state of the vessels they operate, so it is essential to understand the flag state&#39;s
                        requirements and follow the company&#39;s specific guidelines when applying. By fulfilling
                        these requirements and providing the necessary documents, you can obtain your
                        Seaman&#39;s Book and meet the legal prerequisites for your maritime career in the cruise
                        industry.</p>
                    <h3>CREW VISA: C1/D</h3>
                    <p>Prior to joining the cruiseship you will need to apply for a Seaman’s Visa at the US
                        Embassy. It is Transit and Seamen Visa. You may need another visa depending on the
                        port where you will join. We will let you know. Visa costs are covered by the company
                        – however you will need to pay at the time you make the online application at the
                        Embassy, and then present your receipt onboard the ship when you join and the cost
                        will be refunded to you. <br>
                        A tourist visa is not valid for this type of job. You will receive an LOE (Letter of
                        Employment or a Consulate Letter) so you can obtain your visa. This visa is not
                        required for Canadians or US citizens or residents.</p>

                    <p>ISOL does not charge any fees to candidates for its services. However, it is essential to
                        note that there are some expenses you may need to cover during the process of
                        joining a ship. These expenses include obtaining a passport, undergoing required
                        medical examinations, and completing the mandatory STCW (Standards of Training,
                        Certification, and Watchkeeping) training.</p>
                    <p class="text-bold">Additionally, candidates might have to pay for their flights, depending on the
                        specific
                        position they are applying for. It is crucial to factor in these costs while planning your
                        financial arrangements and ensuring you are prepared for the necessary expenses
                        associated with joining a ship in the maritime industry.</p>
                    <p>It is crucial to understand that the fees related to passport acquisition, medical
                        examinations, mandatory STCW training, and flights (when applicable) are paid directly
                        by the candidate to the respective service providers, such as embassies, doctors,
                        training centers, and airlines.
                        <br>
                        As a candidate, it is your responsibility to manage these expenses and ensure you have
                        the necessary funds available to cover these costs. Communicate with the service
                        providers to understand their payment procedures, requirements, and any additional
                        fees that may be involved. Keep all relevant receipts and documentation for potential
                        reimbursement, if applicable.
                        <br>
                        By being aware of these expenses and making the necessary arrangements, you can
                        ensure a smoother transition into your maritime career while adhering to the financial
                        obligations associated with joining a ship.
