                        which is subject to this indemnification upon becoming aware of it.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3>19. USER DATA&nbsp;</h3>

                    <h3>20. ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS, TRANSACTIONS, AND SIGNATURES&nbsp;</h3>
                    <p>Visiting the Services, sending us emails, and completing online forms constitute electronic

                        signature or delivery or retention of non-electronic records, or to payments or the granting of
                        credits by any means other than electronic means.&nbsp;</p>
                    <h3>21. MISCELLANEOUS&nbsp;</h3>
                    <p>These Legal Terms and any policies or operating rules posted by us on the Services or in respect
                        to the Services constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our
                        failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms shall not operate as
                        a waiver of such right or provision. These Legal Terms operate to the fullest extent permissible
                        by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall
                        not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause
                        beyond our reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision of these Legal Terms is
                        determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is
                        deemed severable from these Legal Terms and does not affect the &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership,
                        employment or agency relationship created between you and us as a result of these Legal Terms or
                        use of the Services. You agree that these Legal Terms will not be construed against us by virtue
                        of having drafted them. You&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form of these Legal Terms
                        and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Legal Terms.&nbsp;</p>
